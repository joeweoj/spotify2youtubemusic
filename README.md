## Notes

* Built using [Spotipy](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [ytmusicapi](https://ytmusicapi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) üôè
* This was a personal project to migrate a few specific playlist, therefore it is very hacky, unsupported, subject to occassional rate limiting, use at own risk etc etc
